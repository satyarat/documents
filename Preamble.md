The preamble describes the intentions and purpose of this software mechanism for a decentralized, distributed and unsupervised way of providing **Source of Truth (SoT)**. This forms the base of the rest of the process. Specifications should not deviate from what is stated herein.

The basic intention and purpose is to attempt to bring forth a medium that can bring transparency and infallibility to certain key areas of the social fabric of the world that it seems to be struggling with, and to do it with as much simplicity as possible. In fact a lot of our issues can be eased, if we can have a completely trustworthy SoT mechanism.

In order to achieve this, we require a way to provide an unbreachable safe box (metaphorically) where messages can be exchanged securely, without loss and tampering, and without any centralized and supervised mechanism. We also require that data remains available for as long as required and no one should be able to influence/alter the mechanism and/or change or delete the data it will hold. Lastly, we require that the mechanism must be able to prevent any unintended use. Thus this forms the basic idea of what we wish to have.

The best option to implement this mechanism is to use distributed computing resources, which, quite naturally would be provided by the very users who intend to use this mechanism. A user will have to part with limited computing resources to join the others on the ether.

Furthermore, we want this to be as simple as possible. Simplicity would bring both efficiency and resilience. This means that the mechanism needs to function on the simplest of data structuring and relations. It should rely on simple but unbreachable ways of consuming inputs and providing outputs. Its only job will be to provide SoT and any auxiliary functions will only be to make this primary function robust, easy and trustful.

Since this entire mechanism will be in public domain and completely transparent, we would need a way to transparently forge and secure the binaries of the software that a node on the ether will run. The ether should be formed with the combination of this forge and the binaries it will publish, which also means that there can be multiple ‘ethers’ independent of each other, and having varied expanse of influence.

To summarize the gist – we intend to have a mechanism for SoT that has no-master, where data cannot be tampered with or used for unintended purposes, and where data can potentially reach a state of imperishable persistence while not losing availability at any point of time.

For this mechanism, the following principles are listed:

1. To be closed to any dominion, influence or alterations
2. To ensure data remains immutable
3. Ensure output remains unaffected by data corruption
4. To provide a way for data to persist as long as required
5. To ensure data cannot be used for unintended purposes
6. To ensure data cannot be accessed in anyway other than the system permits
7. To give intuitive, easy and secure ways to the user to protect their data and exchange messages
8. To be simple, as much as possible

This concludes the preamble.
